# Maintaining Route Information During SPA Authentication In Lucee CFML

This is a small exploration that looks at the challenges of maintaining route information during a SPA (Single-Page Application) authentication workflow in a Lucee CFML application. This requires passing some sort or "redirect" value around from page-to-page and then forwarding the user to that redirect after they have logged-in. The login workflow may or may not include external services, such as Single Sign-On (SSO) providers that are out of our control.

The `ingress.cfm` file contains two types of link examples:

* Those generated by the application and purposefully exposed.

* Those copy-pasted by one logged-in user to another user.

While both point to an internal view within the application, they use two different route mechanics (URL fragment vs. URL query string).
